Max 4ds Tools is a plugin for 3ds Max written in MaxScript that adds support for Mafia 4ds model format.  
It aims to provide an easy to use set of tools for either editing existing models or for creating them from scratch.  
It's based on the work by Mr F, but almost everything has been rewritten and a lot of features were added.
